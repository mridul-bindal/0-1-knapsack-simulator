# 0/1 Knapsack Simulator

An interactive and beginner-friendly web-based simulator to visualize how the **0/1 Knapsack Problem** is solved using **Dynamic Programming**.

This tool allows users to add items, set a knapsack capacity, and then step through the solution with helpful animations and explanations.

---

## Features

- Add items with weight and value.
- Set the knapsack's maximum capacity.
- Dynamic programming table is built in real-time.
- Color-coded animation to highlight decisions:
  - Highlighted cell: Current step
  - Include: Item considered for inclusion
  - Exclude: Item skipped or too heavy
- Shows final result with:
  - Maximum achievable value
  - List of selected items
- Option to reset and run multiple simulations.
